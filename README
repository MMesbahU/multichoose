Multiset combinations, k multichoose n

multichoose.cpp --

This is a small C++ program which contains a generic function to generate multisets for vectors of any type of object.  You can test out the program using strings input from the command line by typing:

    % make

Running:

    % ./multichoose

Prints usage information:

    usage: 
    ./multichoose <k> <item1> <item2> ... <itemN>  ~ n multichoose k

Example usage:

    % ./multichoose 2 a t g c
    ( c c )
    ( g c )
    ( g g )
    ( t c )
    ( t g )
    ( t t )
    ( a c )
    ( a g )
    ( a t )
    ( a a )

This example lists all the possible *unordered' genotypes at a given genetic
loci of which there are two copies (e.g. chromosomes).  'k' (2 in this case)
could be understood as the expected ploidy of the given locus.  Applying
multiset permutations to each of the results would generate all possible
ordered multisets.
